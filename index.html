        <p class="lead mb-4">My first job was at Panera when I was a senior in high school. I started my second semester and worked until the end of my senior year of high school. I learned many lessons and am very grateful to have had these experiences earlier in life. When I first started I was very scared but excited to work and earn money for myself. I worked at the cashier in the front and also was in charge of the pastries and drinks. When a customer ordered a pastry or drink whether it was in person or online I had to get their pastry in the front and pack it up nicely. For the drinks I had to make sure I had all the right measurements so the drink was made properly. In these two roles I learned to do things in a timely manner and also learned how to talk to customers. For example, when preparing drinks like a smoothie I had to make sure I had the right amount of ice and fruits but also had to do it in a timely manner because many times there was rush hour so many people were waiting for their order and you had to make sure you werenâ€™t behind. I also learned to communicate with orders while doing my part of the job. When I was done making a drink or grabbing the pastries for the order I had to make sure it was for the correct order and made sure the other team members knew which order it was for. At first it took some time to adjust how to put in an order on the register but after a week or so I knew where everything was on the screen. I was also in charge of refilling things like napkins and the coffees. Everything that I needed to refill was in the back and I had to get used to where everything was and not get it mixed up with all the other items that were in the back. There was also the fridge that I had to restock that had fruit, yogurt, milk, cream, and coffee. Some of these things were in the back freezer and some were in the back next to the oven. Most of the time I was scheduled on the night shift which meant I had to close the whole store. My job was to sweep and mop the front part of the store and my bakery section I was in charge of. Then I had to clean the restrooms and make sure everything was filled like the toilet paper and paper towels. At the end of the store there were three big trash cans and in the middle of the store at the coffee station there was another trash can. I had to empty all four trash cans and fill them with new trash bags and tie them down so they fit nicely on the trash can. After all my duties were done my manager would approve of me and I would be able to go home after a long day of being in charge of all these tasks.

        My second job I started was at BBQ Chicken in brea. I started a month into my summer after I came back from my senior trip. I received four sessions of training where I learned all the duties I had to fulfill as a cashier. The biggest difference I noticed between my previous job at Panera and my job at BBQ Chicken was that the rush hour was much more intense and busy. My job was to take orders whether it was in person or through the phone. Then I had to pack their order correctly and make sure that each person got the proper order. This step was very crucial because if someone took the wrong order then the customer would either have to come back or my manager would have to drive and make the delivery himself. At times that we were in rush hour normally around five to eight because we receive so many orders the kitchen would be backed up with orders and sometimes the wait time for an order would be forty-five minutes to an hour. I also had to make sure that each order got the right amount of sides such as drinks and sauces. When I have customers complaining about the wait time I would have to explain to them in an appropriate manner that we fry the chicken when an order comes in so it's fresh and not sitting out so it takes time for the people in the kitchen to get their order ready. I usually worked on weekends and on weekend nights it is the busiest time out of the whole week so there would be two people working instead of one. I learned that I had to communicate with the other person I was working with. For example one person would be in charge of packing up the orders because the majority of the orders would be a takeout order. Then the other person would be in charge of everything else other than the takeout orders which were dine in customers. When customers dined in we would have to be in charge of taking their orders, bringing the correct order to their table because when there are multiple dine in customers it could get confusing, and any refills or anything else they needed. Then finally when the day was over I would have to close the store. This included sweeping the whole store including the restroom. I also had to clean the restroom like mopping it, refilling anything, taking out the trash, and wiping down the mirrors. Because the fans are turned on from the morning I have to turn all the fans off, turn the air conditioner off, turn off all the tv screens, and also turn off the neon open sign off. Then I had to count all the cash that was in the cash drawer and input it into the register and if anything was off I had to either recount or tell my manager. After counting all the cash, I would have to get the managerâ€™s signature of approval.

        As president of the Hope for Young Leaders club, I have had a lot of experience with communication and organization. Through the club, we focus our efforts on helping children from low income backgrounds by raising money from varying events and giving back by buying them christmas gifts, clothes, shoes, and canned food. We hold many events such as cookie bake sales, garage sales, and beach or park recycling days to raise money.As we started doing events together, I noticed that the club was not very integrated, or close-knit. I struggled to get to know the male-dominated group, often unsure of how to breach the invisible barrier that seemed to keep us from connecting. I began by attempting to broach conversations with them more frequently and trying to find things in common. Slowly, they started opening up to me; we began meeting up to coordinate events together. Last year, we decided to bake cookies to sell. To break the tension, instead of letting each person do different things, I placed all the club members  ingroups so they would need to interact  during each step. It became a team building exercise of my own creation,   that ultimately brought us closer together, something I had not anticipated. Whenever I mention our baking event they all laugh and agree in unison about how fun and memorable that day was. At first, I thought being the president of this club would prove simple  - I got to make decisions, plan events and take part in community service opportunities. I got to be in charge of something, build upon something - ideas that drew me in. But I underestimated the hard work and determination that went into helping a community become a successful, united front. .  Although it took time and effort to get the club to where I wanted, it was all worth it.  Getting the members together as a group and perform as a club together was not easy but through events like the baking event, it helped create a fun and comfortable environment. Being able to see how close we have gotten then when we started made me very proud and happy about our accomplishments. From awkward distant meetings to making fun memories with exciting events. I didnâ€™t realize how much planning and stress would go into being president. I often lost self-confidence and had burnouts from not being able to plan out events and thinking I would let my fellow members down. I talked to some of the members and they were able to help me not get stressed out and it made me motivated to stay positive and push through those hard days by having a better mindset. Even though I would get discouraged by these days, I knew that I could lean on my club members and propose new ideas to them. I underestimated how easy being the president of a club and doing nails may be by only seeing the positives. A big factor that changed both of these outcomes was not getting discouraged by failed attempts but earning and bettering myself through them. Through these two experiences I learned that just like painting nails takes a lot of time and effort to perfect small little details, being the president of a club also shares these same challenges. Although it may be hard at first, if I am determined to do them then I could get the results I expect.
